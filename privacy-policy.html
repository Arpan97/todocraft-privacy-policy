    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <p>
            This Privacy Policy applies to the TodoCraft – Tasks & Planner app (the "Application") created by Arpan
            Govila ("Developer") as a free offline productivity tool.
            The app is provided "AS IS" and does not collect, store, or share any personal information.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
        <p><strong>The Application does not collect any personal data.</strong></p>
        <p>TodoCraft works entirely offline. All tasks, notes, settings, and related data are stored locally on your
            device and never transmitted to any server.</p>
        <p>The Application:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Does NOT collect personal information</li>
            <li>Does NOT require an internet connection</li>
            <li>Does NOT use analytics, crash reporting, or third-party SDKs</li>
            <li>Does NOT share data with anyone</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Permissions</h2>
        <p>
            TodoCraft may request minimal permissions (if any) only for features inside the app, such as saving app
            data.
            All information remains securely stored within the user’s device.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Third-Party Access</h2>
        <p>
            The Application does not use any external services, third-party APIs, or cloud storage.
            No data is shared with external companies or servers.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Data Storage and Retention</h2>
        <p>
            All data created within TodoCraft—such as tasks, reminders, and preferences—is stored **locally on your
            device**.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the app is uninstalled, all data will be deleted permanently unless you manually back it up using your
            device’s storage system.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
        <p>
            You may delete your data at any time by:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Using the in-app delete features, or</li>
            <li>Uninstalling the application from your device.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Since all data is stored locally, deletion is immediate and irreversible.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            The Application does not collect any data from users, including children under 13.
            TodoCraft is safe for general use and does not request personal or sensitive information.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>
            The security of your data depends on your device. As no information leaves your device, we recommend
            enabling device-level security features (PIN, fingerprint, face unlock, etc.) for protection.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>
            This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically. Any changes will be posted on this page.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Your Consent</h2>
        <p>
            By using the Application, you agree to this Privacy Policy.
        </p>
    </div>
